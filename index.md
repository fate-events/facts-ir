## Welcome

# Workshop Objectives

This half-day workshop explores challenges in responsible information retrieval system development and deployment. The focus will be on determining actionable research agendas on four key dimensions of responsible information retrieval: fairness, accountability, confidentiality, and transparency. Rather than a mini-conference, this workshop will be an event during which participants will be expected to work. The workshop aims to bring together a diverse set of researchers and practitioners interested in helping to develop the technical research agenda for responsible information retrieval.
