## FACTS-IR Workshop @ SIGIR 2019

# Workshop Objectives
This workshop explores challenges in responsible information retrieval system development and deployment. The focus will be on determining actionable research agendas on five key dimensions of responsible information retrieval: fairness, accountability, confidentiality, and transparency. Rather than just a mini-conference, this workshop will be an event during which participants will also be expected to work.  The workshop aims to bring together a diverse set of researchers and practitioners interested in helping to develop the technical research agenda for responsible information retrieval. 

The full-day workshop will be organize in two parts: 
* The first half-day will include presentations, based on the accepted papers by our PC members
* For the second half-day, participants will be organized in working groups and tasked with articulating a research agenda for one of the FACTS-IR topics (Fairness, Accountability, Confidentiality, Transparency, and Safety)

To ensure that the working groups in the second part of the workshop will be productive, we may cap the number of participants. 

# Call for Papers
The purpose of the workshop is to identify gaps in the technical emerging work on responsible IR, including undertheorized and underspecified issues related to each of these four areas of focus.  We aim to create actionable technical research agendas for each of them. 

To this end, we welcome technical contributions and position papers as either long papers (8 pages) or extended abstracts (2-4 pages) on a wide range of topics, including:

### Fair IR
The IR system should avoid discrimination across people and communities. To do so the notion of fairness should be contextual and well grounded in the application setup and domain. Achieving fairness may be further complicated by the multi-stakeholder nature of most IR systems.

### Accountable IR
The IR system should be able to justify its recommendations or actions to users and other stakeholders, as well as be reliable at all times.  This requires an understanding of the potential harms of using the system and of who is more likely to be affected.  It also requires recourse avenues and processes for redress.

### Confidential IR 
The output or actions of the IR system should not reveal secrets. IR systems often combine extensive behavioral logs to model their users, which if not properly handled can result in unintended leakage of information.   

### Transparent IR
The IR system should be able to explain why and how the suggested results were obtained to users and other interested stakeholders.  Providing proper explanations may require to answer who the users and the stakeholders are.  More broadly, the IR systems should be able to enable third parties to monitor and probe that they behave as expected. 

### Safe IR 
The IR system should be resilient to manipulation by possible adversarial parties, and should not expose the users to undesirable, harmful content.  

FACTS-IR is interested in technical contributions on these topics.
